# Crossword Puzzle Generator

## Overview

Crossword Puzzle Generator is a program designed to generate crossword puzzles by solving a constraint satisfaction problem. Given the structure of a crossword puzzle grid and a list of words, the program aims to fill in each sequence of squares with appropriate words while satisfying unary and binary constraints.

## Problem Statement

The problem involves choosing words to fill each vertical or horizontal sequence of squares in a crossword puzzle grid. Each sequence of squares is treated as a variable, defined by its starting row, starting column, direction (across or down), and length. The program needs to find a satisfying assignment where each variable has a word from the provided vocabulary list that meets its length and overlaps correctly with neighboring variables.

## Constraints

- **Unary Constraints:** Each variable's length defines its unary constraint. Words from the vocabulary list that don't match the required length are eliminated from consideration.
- **Binary Constraints:** Variables have binary constraints based on their overlap with neighboring variables. The characters at the overlap positions must match. Additionally, the constraint that all words must be different is enforced.

## Approach

The program utilizes constraint satisfaction techniques to find a satisfying assignment:
1. **Initialize:** Start with an empty crossword grid and a list of variables representing the crossword puzzle structure.
2. **Eliminate:** Remove words from the vocabulary list that do not satisfy the unary constraints of each variable.
3. **Search:** Use backtracking or other search algorithms to find a solution that satisfies both unary and binary constraints.
4. **Enforce Constraints:** Ensure that all words used are different.
5. **Output:** Generate the filled crossword puzzle grid as the final output.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement more efficient search algorithms to improve performance on larger puzzles.
- Integrate natural language processing techniques for better word selection and constraint satisfaction.
- Develop a user interface for creating custom crossword puzzles and solving them interactively.
